# MuscleHubA-BTest

Currently, when a visitor to MuscleHub is considering buying a membership, he or she follows the following steps:

1. Take a fitness test with a personal trainer
2. Fill out an application for the gym
3. Send in their payment for their first monthâ€™s membership
4. Janet, the manager of MuscleHub, thinks that the fitness test intimidates some prospective members, so she has set up an A/B test.

Visitors will randomly be assigned to one of two groups:

1. Group A will still be asked to take a fitness test with a personal trainer
2. Group B will skip the fitness test and proceed directly to the application

Janet's hypothesis is that visitors assigned to Group B will be more likely to eventually purchase a membership to MuscleHub.

I will help her analyze the data and create a presentation. It shows SQL and pandas techniques for determining significance between the results of an A/B marketing test.
